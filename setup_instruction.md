To use Trifacta, you can apply for a 30-day trial account on https://www.trifacta.com/start-wrangling/. 
Alternatively, if you would like to re-create the tech demo in our presentation. You can sign up for an account on cloud.google.com. You should get some free credits upon signup.

When running the tech demo, we used Google BigQuery to import the entire store data. The data size is quite large and thus we provide a sample data for interested users to try out.
We provide the entire 29 steps we have done to create the post_processed data as two screenshots. They are done in Trifacta and do not require any code writing.   

The Python script can replicate the same process we have done in Trifacta. It serves as a comparison to show the easy use of Trifacta, especially for non-technical analysts. 

Should you have any question regarding the tech demo, please contact us through the email addressed provided on the flyer.
